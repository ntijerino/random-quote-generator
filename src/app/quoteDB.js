Or think, or do. Only what you do."},{"author":"Nassim Nicholas Taleb","quote":"You find peace by coming to terms with what you don’t know."},{"author":"William James","quote":"The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook."},{"author":"Nassim Nicholas Taleb","quote":"A stoic is a Buddhist with attitude."},{"author":"Albert Einstein","quote":"The ordinary objects of human endeavour – property, outward success, luxury – have always seemed to me contemptible."},{"author":"Brooke Castillo","quote":"Discomfort is the currency of success."},{"author":"Eckhart Tolle","quote":"To complain is always nonacceptance of what is."},{"author":"Marcus Aurelius","quote":"Death smiles at us all, but all a man can do is smile back."},{"author":"Seneca","quote":"The wise man is neither raised up by prosperity nor cast down by adversity; for always he has striven to rely predominantly on himself, and to derive all joy from himself."},{"author":"Seneca","quote":"We should not, like sheep, follow the herd of creatures in front of us, making our way where others go, not where we ought to go."},{"author":"TheAncientSage","quote":"Contentment doesn’t mean you stop improving your situation.

Even the wealthy and the well provided are continually met and frustrated by difficult times and situations.

These are not contradictions. They make a person whole. And above all one must be whole, not fragmentary. @"},{"author":"Seneca","quote":"So, concerning the things we pursue, and for which we vigorously exert ourselves, we owe this consideration – either there is nothing useful in them, or most aren’t useful.
